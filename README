To build locally, first get jekyll (`gem install jekyll bundler`).

Also install any extensions in _congif.yml (eg `gem install octopress-autoprefixer`)

Then run `jekyll serve` from inside the directory.

If you have an issue installing gems due to write permissions, input the following option after the gem command: gem install anygem --user-install

Windows 10: if 'jekyll serve' fail, install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/ version 8 works) will fix it.
