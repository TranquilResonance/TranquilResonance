        <strong>White Tea</strong><br/>
        With a long history in China as one of the most prized teas, white tea is typically considered a lightly oxidized tea. Tender tea shoots are harvested in the spring season then processed. Neither pan-fired nor rolled, white tea is traditionally withered then sun-dried allowing for minimal oxidization during the drying process which changes the flavor profile. Some of the best-known examples of white tea are Silver Needles and White Peony.

        <strong>Green Tea</strong><br/>
        Green teas have been highly prized by the Chinese, from peasants to emperors, for their health benefits, elegant aromas and tastes, and the sheer beauty of the tealeaves. Harvested in the early spring when the tea shoots are young and tender, a low heating is applied to the leaves to stop oxidization, allowing the tealeaves to retain their vibrant green colors and fresh aromatics. Dragon Well and Bi Luo Chun are two of the most famous examples from the hundreds of quality green teas from China’s coastal region.

        <strong>High Fired Oolong Tea</strong><br/>

Higher oxidized than the Green Oolongs, High fired oolongs also go through a higher temperature firing, either with coal or embers, depending on desired flavor profiles.  The combination of higher oxidization and firing produces a more robust, nutty and smoky tea with hints of dried fruit and spice.  Tieguanyin is the most famous example of a rolled high fired oolong

        <strong>Black Tea</strong><br/>
        In China this category is known as “red tea” because of the deep red color of the tea broth. In the west this category is referred to as “black tea” because of the black colored tea leaves. Tealeaves are harvested, withered, and then rolled to oxidize the leaves. Firing, roasting or smoking completes the process and adds to the complexity of the tealeaves. Black tea is highly oxidized to bring out a more robust full-bodied tea, with flavors that range from smoky to fruity to malty. Classic examples of Chinese black teas would include Keemun Maofeng and the Yunnan Blacks.

        <strong>Scented Tea</strong><br/>
        The art of scenting teas has been practiced in China for centuries, challenging the skill of the tea maker to balance aromatics and flavors. Flowers, fruits, and herbs are mixed with teas to add to the complexity or enhance the inherent characteristics of the tealeaves. The art of the tea maker is being able to let the taste of the base tea come through, increase the complexity but never mask the flavors and aromas of the base tea. Jasmine teas are some of the best examples of scented teas from China.
