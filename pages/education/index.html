<h1>Education</h1>
<p>
Tranquil Resonance Studio not only offers lessons in guqin, guzheng, and tea culture at the studio, it is also actively involved in community outreach. Having taught at various schools and culture centers, lectured at various universities throughout the bay area, we offer special presentations, lectures, demonstrations and group classes for the community. Just like the ancient masters, we firmly believe in passing on the traditional music and culture of China to everyone interested.
