<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Tranquil Resonance Studio, established in 1998, was named by the late Chinese painter Huen Moon Yan, translated into English by Prof. Charles Egan, and our logo written in calligraphy by master artist Fu Wenyan, to express the tranquil spirit and energy of music, art, tea, and poetry that emanate from David Wong’s studio. Originally just the name of his studio, a space for him to practice and study, Tranquil Resonance Studio is now a center promoting the learning and understanding of classical Chinese culture, introducing the literati arts to the greater community and forming a bridge that links friends, scholars, artists, and musicians of the East Asian traditions.</p>
<p>With the support of great masters like guzheng virtuoso Liu Weishan, Shanghai Conservatory of Music guqin professor and Guangling Qin School master Dai Xiaolian, Central Conservatory of Music guqin master Li Xiangting, guqin performer Wang Fei, pipa performer Li Linhong, traditional painter Huen Moon Yan of the Guangzhou Art Academy, world renowned artist Zhang Daqian’s student 90 year old master artist Fu Wenyan, and Roy Fong, tea master and proprietor of San Francisco’s most renowned teahouse Imperial Tea Court, Tranquil Resonance Studio strives to promote classical Chinese arts, especially those of the Chinese literati, through lessons, performances, workshops and lectures to the greater community. Tranquil Resonance Studio’s mission is to continue the study of ancient Chinese arts and to pass on this classical culture to the next generation, preserving traditions millennia old.</p>
