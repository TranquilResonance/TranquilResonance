<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Tranquil Resonance Studio, established in 1998, was named by the late Chinese painter Huen
Moon Yan, translated into English by Prof. Charles Egan, and our logo written in calligraphy by
master artist Fu Wenyan, to express the tranquil spirit and energy of music, art, tea, and poetry
that emanate from David Wong’s studio. Originally just the name of his studio, a space for him to
practice and study, Tranquil Resonance Studio is now a center promoting the learning and
understanding of classical Chinese culture, introducing the literati arts to the greater community
and forming a bridge that links friends, scholars, artists, and musicians of the East Asian
traditions.</p>
<p>With the support of great masters like guzheng virtuoso Liu Weishan, Shanghai Conservatory of
Music guqin professor and Guangling Qin School master Dai Xiaolian, Ethnomusicology
professor Dai Wei, and world renowned artist Zhang Daqian’s student 96 year old master artist
Fu Wenyan, Tranquil Resonance Studio strives to promote classical Chinese arts, especially
those of the Chinese literati, through lessons, performances, workshops and lectures to the
greater community. Tranquil Resonance Studio is also home to Tranquil Resonance Guqin Arts
Society whose mission is to promote the music and culture of the guqin, and continue the study of
ancient Chinese arts and to pass on this cultural legacy to the next generation, preserving
traditions millennia old.</p>
